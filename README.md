# Design Patterns Playground

This repository is a personal project to explore and implement all major **design patterns** in **Java**, with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

Each design pattern is implemented in a **separate folder** located in the root directory for better organization and clarity.

---

## 📚 About the Project

- Written in **Java**
- Applies core **OOP concepts** like abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Demonstrates the **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral
- Each pattern is implemented with **clear, self-contained code samples**

---

## 📁 Project Structure


> 🗂 Each folder contains:
> - Java classes and interfaces demonstrating the pattern.
> - A `Main.java` class to run and observe behavior.
> - Optional notes or comments explaining how the pattern works
